This fork hosts the ARM64 builds for MultiMC. These builds are **UNOFFICIAL!** This is *not* supported or endorsed by the MultiMC team in any way!

If you encounter any issues installing, please report them [here](https://github.com/JJTech0130/MultiMC5/issues). If you encounter any issues with the application itself, *test them on the official release!*

> NOTE: ARM32 support is deprecated. Please use the ARM64 version. If you have 32 bit raspbian, use a [64-bit kernel and container](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=232415)
