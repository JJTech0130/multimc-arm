# Installing
To install MultiMC for ARM64, you need to download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/JJTech0130/MultiMC5/releases/) or build it yourself following the instructions [here](build).

Uncompress the build and move it to somewhere suitable, such as `~/MultiMC`.

> If you are on Raspbian, you need to tell QT not to scale the window super large. If you don't do this it will crash the X Server!
>

> You need to add the line `export QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=0` to the beginning of the file, right after the shebang line.
> Save and close the text editor
